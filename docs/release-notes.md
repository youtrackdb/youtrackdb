## Unreleased

### Gremlin order by keeps a record that lacks the ordered property

A global-scope Gremlin `order()` step used to drop a record that carries no value for the
ordered property. That drop acted as a filter. It now keeps the record and sorts it as a
null key, the way the YouTrackDB Query Language (YQL) sorts a missing column.

**Who is affected.** Any query of the form `order().by(key)` over records where the key is
absent on some of them. Such a query returns MORE ROWS after the upgrade. A count after an
order returns a larger number. A `limit` after an order can return different records.

**Why the change.** The Gremlin result and the YQL result for the same sort disagreed. One
dropped the record and the other kept it. The two now agree.

**Nothing else changed.** A local-scope order, a `select` modulator, a `values` step, a
`group` modulator and a `dedup` modulator all keep their current filtering behavior.

**How to restore the old behavior.** Set
`youtrackdb.query.gremlin.orderIncludesMissingKey` to `false`. A deployment can set the
value without recompiling, through a Java system property at startup.

```
-Dyoutrackdb.query.gremlin.orderIncludesMissingKey=false
```

One traversal source can also opt out through the public application programming
interface (API) constant `YTDBQueryConfigParam.orderIncludesMissingKey`.

```java
graph.traversal().with(YTDBQueryConfigParam.orderIncludesMissingKey, false);
```

`StandardOrderSemanticsStrategy` also selects standard order semantics for one traversal source.
Do not combine the strategy with an explicit `orderIncludesMissingKey=true` option.
YouTrackDB rejects that contradiction.

An explicit per-traversal option has the highest precedence. The strategy ranks next.
A database configuration ranks below both traversal routes and above the global setting.

**Known limitation.** Under the including default, an ordered query can lose duplicate
rows. Three conditions must hold together. Several source records reach one target over a
hop, the order key carries an index, and the order applies to that target. The loss affects
the translated path only, and it drops duplicates rather than whole records. The limitation
stands in this version, and a later version repairs it. The
[Gremlin order by guide](gremlin-order-by.md) states the conditions and the workarounds.

**No detection tool exists.** Nothing reports which of your queries change their result.
Review every query that orders by a property which some records do not carry.
