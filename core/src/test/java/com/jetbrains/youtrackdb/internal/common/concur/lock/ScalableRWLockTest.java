   * Verifies that a ScalableRWLock instance is collectible even when threads that previously used

   *
   * <p>The leak scenario: if CleanupAction captures a reference to the ScalableRWLock instance,
   * two GC roots hold opposite ends of a dependency chain, creating a deadlock that prevents
   * collection of both the lock and its ReadersEntry objects:
   *
   * <p><b>GC root 1 — Cleaner daemon thread:</b><br>
   * Cleaner daemon → CleanupAction → ScalableRWLock → ThreadLocal field {@code entry}
   *
   * <p><b>GC root 2 — pool thread T (still alive):</b><br>
   * Thread T → ThreadLocalMap → Entry(WeakReference key: ThreadLocal, strong value: ReadersEntry)
   *
   * <p>The Cleaner daemon won't release CleanupAction until ReadersEntry becomes
   * phantom-reachable. But ReadersEntry is strongly reachable from Thread T's ThreadLocalMap
   * because the lock (kept alive by CleanupAction) keeps the ThreadLocal key strongly reachable,
   * so the WeakReference key is never cleared, so the map entry is never stale. Neither GC root
   * lets go, and the primary leak manifests as growing {@code readersStateList}: every pool
   * thread that ever touches the lock leaves behind a ReadersEntry that can never be cleaned up.
   *
   * <p>With the fix (CleanupAction captures only the needed fields, not the lock), dropping
   * all external references to the lock breaks the deadlock: the lock becomes weakly reachable
   * and is collected, the ThreadLocal key goes weak and is cleared, the ReadersEntry eventually
   * becomes phantom-reachable, and the Cleaner fires to remove it from {@code readersStateList}.
   *
   * <p>Note: this test relies on {@code System.gc()} actually triggering collection. With the
   * default G1 collector on JDK 21+ this is reliable, but it may be flaky under unusual GC
   * configurations (e.g. Epsilon GC or very large heaps) where {@code System.gc()} is a no-op.
