/**
 * Multi-thread pins for the per-component-lock invariant on three production hot paths
 * that share a {@code fileId}: the BTree/SLBB/CPMV2/PCV2 allocator audit conclusion
 * (callers enter under {@code executeInsideComponentOperation} /
 * {@code calculateInsideComponentOperation} / {@code acquireExclusiveLockTillOperationComplete}).
 * Each {@code @Test} drives a repeated-rounds shape ({@value #ROUNDS} rounds, fresh
 * component instance per round, {@link CyclicBarrier}(2) start gate) that pins the
 * production-side invariant: passes today, fails loudly if a future change drops the
 * lock and lets two concurrent allocators target the same {@code (fileId, pageIndex)}.
 *
 * <h2>Coverage map</h2>
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>{@link #cpmv2AllocateUnderSharedClusterToleratesConcurrentAllocators}</b> —
 *       drives two concurrent {@code CollectionPositionMapV2.allocate} call sites on the
 *       same cluster's CPMV2 instance via the public
 *       {@code PaginatedCollectionV2.allocatePosition} surface. The lock contract this
 *       pins is the PCV2-wrapping-CPMV2 lock contract: {@code PCV2.allocatePosition}
 *       enters under PCV2's {@code calculateInsideComponentOperation}, which acquires
 *       the per-component exclusive lock on {@code this} of the {@link
 *       com.jetbrains.youtrackdb.internal.core.storage.collection.v2.PaginatedCollectionV2}
 *       instance, and only then calls {@code CollectionPositionMapV2.allocate}.
 *       The test therefore detects a regression that dropped the lock on
 *       {@code PCV2.allocatePosition}; a regression that dropped the lock on
 *       {@code CPMV2.allocate} alone (a path no production caller exercises today —
 *       every production entry into {@code CPMV2.allocate} flows through PCV2's
 *       wrapping lock) would not surface here. Without the PCV2 lock, two allocators
 *       on the same cluster would race the entry-point page write lock and the
 *       cache-layer fast-fail {@code IllegalStateException} in
 *       {@code WOWCache.loadOrAdd} would surface a hard crash on the loser of the
 *       allocator race.
 *   <li><b>{@link #pcv2AllocateNewPageUnderSharedClusterToleratesConcurrentAppends}</b> —
 *       drives two concurrent {@code PaginatedCollectionV2.allocateNewPage} call sites
 *       on the same cluster's PCV2 instance via the public {@code createRecord} surface
 *       with a payload larger than {@code CollectionPage.MAX_RECORD_SIZE} so the FSM
 *       cannot locate an existing page that fits the record and {@code findNewPageToWrite}
 *       fires on every call (the new-page allocator branch is taken deterministically).
 *       Same per-component lock invariant as the CPMV2 case above, but on the data file
 *       ({@code .pcl}) and the state-page write lock.
 *   <li><b>{@link #ihmBuildHistogramUnderSharedIndexToleratesConcurrentBuilds}</b> —
 *       drives two concurrent {@code BTreeMultiValueIndexEngine.buildInitialHistogram}
 *       call sites on the same index's engine. The multi-value engine's production
 *       caller path enters {@code IndexHistogramManager.writeSnapshotToPage} via
 *       {@code mgr.buildHistogram} with a non-empty scanned key stream + populated
 *       HLL sketch. Both workers run the full
 *       {@code scanAndBuild} → {@code fitToPage} → {@code writeSnapshotToPage} path
 *       (positive-evidence: the IHM snapshot's {@code totalCount} equals the
 *       inserted entity count after the round), and the lock is acquired directly
 *       via {@code AtomicOperationsManager.acquireExclusiveLockTillOperationComplete}.
 *       This surface is deliberately chosen over {@code flushIfDirty}: {@code
 *       flushIfDirty} gates its body behind a {@code DIRTY_MUTATIONS.compareAndSet}
 *       that admits exactly one CAS-winner per round (so the loser fast-returns
 *       without touching the lock), making it impossible to drive two concurrent
 *       lock-acquiring threads through that path. {@code buildInitialHistogram} has
 *       no CAS gate — both threads enter {@code writeSnapshotToPage} unconditionally,
 *       and the lock is the only structural barrier serialising their page-0 access.
 *       A regression that dropped the lock at {@code writeSnapshotToPage} would
 *       surface as an {@code IllegalStateException} from the cache-layer fast-fail
 *       in {@code WOWCache.loadOrAdd} on the loser of the page-0 allocate-or-load
 *       race. <b>Coverage gap:</b> this test does NOT pin the page-1 allocator-side
 *       discriminator branch at the {@code op.filledUpTo > 1 ? load : allocate} arm
 *       inside {@code writeSnapshotToPage} — HLL-spill calibration is sensitive to
 *       JVM-global static knobs (see Javadoc on the @Test method for the
 *       propagation gap) and platform serializer encoding details, so spill firing
 *       is not deterministic in this test. A narrow regression that broke spill
 *       calibration (e.g., {@code fitToPage} returning early on the second pass)
 *       would pass this test for the wrong reason on the spill dimension;
 *       coverage of that branch is deferred to the dedicated unit test
 *       {@code IndexHistogramManagerSpillDiscriminatorTest}.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Repeated-rounds + {@link CyclicBarrier}(2) shape</h2>
 *
 * <p>Each {@code @Test} runs {@value #ROUNDS} rounds. Each round provisions a fresh
 * component instance (a new class for CPMV2 / PCV2, a new index for IHM) so the
 * allocator state on round {@code N} is independent of round {@code N-1}. The
 * {@link CyclicBarrier}(2) re-arms each round and gates both threads at the call site,
 * maximising the chance that the two allocator entries land in the same scheduler
 * slice — the contention window the per-component lock is meant to close.
 *
 * <h2>Coverage shape</h2>
 *
 * <p>The CPMV2 and PCV2 entry points
 * ({@link #cpmv2AllocateUnderSharedClusterToleratesConcurrentAllocators},
 * {@link #pcv2AllocateNewPageUnderSharedClusterToleratesConcurrentAppends}) hold TWO
 * locks at the allocator site: the AOM per-component lock acquired by
 * {@code calculateInsideComponentOperation}, and an inner
 * {@code acquireExclusiveLock()} on the same {@code SharedResourceAbstract} instance
 * (a reentrant {@link java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock}). Reentrancy
 * makes the inner call a no-op while the AOM lock is held. As a result, the CPMV2 /
 * PCV2 cases only fail on a "both-locks-dropped" regression — a regression that drops
 * only the AOM-level wrap (the documented per-component-lock contract on
 * {@code WriteCache.loadOrAdd} / {@code AtomicOperation.allocatePageForWrite}) is
 * masked here because the inner reentrant lock still serialises the two threads.
 * The IHM case ({@link #ihmBuildHistogramUnderSharedIndexToleratesConcurrentBuilds})
 * is single-locked (AOM only), so a regression at the AOM layer there fails the suite
 * unambiguously.
 *
 * <h2>Configuration</h2>
 *
 * <p>The test runs under {@code checksumMode = StoreAndThrow} (the production CI
 * default for disk-mode tests, and the stance under which the original poison cascade
 * surfaced). The magic-check leg of the cascade is silenced when checksums are off, so
 * the regression gate must stay green under the production-default checksum stance.
 *
 * <p>The {@code SequentialTest} category routes the class through the sequential-tests
 * surefire execution: it sets {@code GlobalConfiguration.STORAGE_CHECKSUM_MODE}
 * indirectly via the per-instance builder and opens a disk-mode storage. Parallel
 * forks touching the same build directory would interfere with each other's file
 * allocation accounting.
