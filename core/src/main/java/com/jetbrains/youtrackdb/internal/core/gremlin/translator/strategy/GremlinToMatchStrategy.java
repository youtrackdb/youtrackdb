/**
 * Provider-optimization strategy that rewrites a fully-recognized Gremlin traversal into a
 * YouTrackDB MATCH execution plan and replaces the traversal's entire step list with a single
 * {@link YTDBMatchPlanStep} boundary. Translation is all-or-nothing: if
 * <em>any</em> step is outside the recognized set the strategy declines the whole traversal
 * and the native TinkerPop pipeline — including the three pre-existing YTDB half-measure
 * strategies — keeps handling it verbatim. A translated traversal therefore contains exactly
 * one step (the boundary); a declined traversal is left byte-for-byte unchanged.
 *
 * <h2>Current state — recognizes the vertex source only</h2>
 *
 * <p>The whole-traversal walk is delegated to {@link GremlinToMatchTranslator#translate},
 * which drives the shared {@code GremlinStepWalker} + {@code StepRecogniser} registry. Phase 1
 * recognizes only the vertex source ({@code g.V()} / {@code g.V(ids)}); any traversal carrying
 * an unrecognized step declines whole and stays on the native pipeline. On a recognized shape
 * {@code apply} runs its gates, receives a non-empty translation, and splices the boundary
 * step in place of the entire step list ({@link #applyTranslation}). Landing the gating
 * cascade + throw-safety net + kill-switch before any recognizer ran under the strategy was
 * deliberate: it guarantees the "a translator bug in {@code apply} can only ever decline, never break
 * a query" invariant holds from the moment the strategy is first registered. The one throw meant to
 * reach the caller is a {@link ReservedAliasException} — a prohibited user alias in the reserved
 * {@code $} namespace — which the net re-throws rather than degrades (see "Throw-safety net").
 *
 * <h2>Gating cascade</h2>
 *
 * The strategy declines (returns without mutating the traversal) when any of the following is
 * true, checked in order:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>No YouTrackDB session / kill switch.</b> The traversal has no attached {@link
 *       YTDBGraph} (e.g. an anonymous {@code __.V()} detached traversal, or a non-YTDB graph),
 *       the session exposes no {@code ContextConfiguration} (its {@code getConfiguration()} is
 *       {@code @Nullable}), or {@link
 *       GlobalConfiguration#QUERY_GREMLIN_TO_MATCH_TRANSLATOR_ENABLED} is {@code false} for the
 *       traversal's session. Reading the flag per-session gives operators a runtime kill-switch
 *       without a redeploy; an unresolvable configuration declines rather than throwing.</li>
 *   <li><b>Non-graph / non-vertex start.</b> The first step is not a start-emitting {@link
 *       GraphStep}, or it is an edge start ({@code g.E()}). The current translator only models
 *       vertex-rooted patterns; edge starts are a later milestone. This O(1) start-shape gate
 *       runs before the O(steps) idempotency scan below, so a non-vertex traversal declines
 *       without walking its whole step list. Gating on the plain TinkerPop
 *       {@link GraphStep} (not {@code
 *       YTDBGraphStep}) is deliberate: this strategy runs <em>before</em> {@code
 *       YTDBGraphStepStrategy} — the sole producer of {@code YTDBGraphStep} — so at translator
 *       time the start step is still a plain {@code GraphStep}. Keying on {@code YTDBGraphStep}
 *       would decline every recognized shape. The check is also ordering-robust, since a
 *       {@code YTDBGraphStep} <em>is</em> a {@code GraphStep}.</li>
 *   <li><b>Per-traversal veto.</b> {@link RepeatDeclineStrategy#isVetoed} answers true, because
 *       {@link RepeatDeclineStrategy} marked the traversal at decoration time — it marks every
 *       traversal whose subtree was written with {@code repeat(...)}. The marker is how a decision
 *       taken before {@code RepeatUnrollStrategy} flattened the repeat survives into this pass; see
 *       that class for why the decline cannot be made here, and for why the marker is carried on
 *       the traversal's strategies <em>reference</em> without altering the list it points at.</li>
 *   <li><b>Idempotency.</b> The traversal already contains a boundary step ({@link
 *       AbstractMatchPlanStep}, either the single-plan {@link YTDBMatchPlanStep} or any other
 *       concrete boundary form) anywhere in its step list. A traversal's strategy chain can be
 *       applied more than once
 *       (clone-for-reuse, test-harness re-application, lazy first-iteration apply); leaving an
 *       already-translated traversal alone keeps rewriting deterministic and avoids discarding
 *       a built plan.</li>
 *   <li><b>No translation.</b> {@link GremlinToMatchTranslator#translate} returns {@code null}
 *       — no whole-traversal translation is available because the walker declined a step.
 *       Replacing zero steps would be a no-op, so the strategy returns.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <h2>Throw-safety net</h2>
 *
 * {@code apply} runs inside {@code traversal.applyStrategies()}, which fires on <em>every</em>
 * Gremlin traversal compilation, and the strategy is registered globally for all YTDB graph
 * traversals. An uncaught exception in {@code apply} would abort compilation for that
 * traversal, and the blast radius of a translator / walker bug would be every Gremlin query
 * the server runs, not only the recognized shapes. The whole body therefore runs inside a
 * {@code try} that catches {@link RuntimeException} and turns any ordinary failure — a walker bug, a
 * recognizer NPE, a malformed {@code MatchPlanInputs}, a planner exception — into a clean
 * decline: the method returns and the original step list is preserved for the native pipeline
 * (which, under the all-or-nothing rule, is at least as well-served as before). The net
 * degrades a translator bug to native execution rather than a broken query, and it exists from
 * the skeleton so the invariant holds before any recognizer runs under the strategy.
 *
 * <p>The net makes one deliberate exception. A {@link ReservedAliasException} — thrown by the
 * walker's reserved-prefix pre-flight when a user {@code as(...)} label sits in the reserved {@code
 * $} namespace — rejects prohibited input rather than reporting a translator failure, so the {@code
 * catch} re-throws it (caught before the {@link RuntimeException} clause) and the query fails with a
 * clear error. Native execution would accept the {@code $} label, so degrading this to a decline
 * would let a prohibited alias run silently; propagating it is the point.
 *
 * <p>The catch is narrowed to {@link RuntimeException}, so {@link Error} — including {@link
 * AssertionError} — is never swallowed: it is not a {@code RuntimeException} and propagates
 * untouched. Under {@code -ea} (the test/CI default) a genuine invariant violation in the walk
 * or plan build must surface loudly instead of degrading to a silent decline that masks a real
 * bug, and a fatal {@code OutOfMemoryError} / {@code StackOverflowError} must not be handed to
 * the native pipeline to re-attempt in an already-exhausted JVM. The body throws only unchecked
 * exceptions — its calls go through the {@code TraversalTranslator} / {@code MatchPlanBuilder}
 * seams and TinkerPop APIs — so {@code RuntimeException} covers every failure that can actually
 * occur.
 *
 * <p>The net catches during the walk and the plan build; the actual step-list mutation happens
 * only after both succeed (see {@link #applyTranslation}), so a caught exception always leaves
 * the step list untouched.
 *
 * <h2>Strategy ordering</h2>
 *
 * The strategy declares <b>empty</b> {@link #applyPrior()} and {@link #applyPost()}. Ordering
 * relative to the three half-measure strategies is established the canonical TinkerPop way:
 * each half-measure strategy lists {@code GremlinToMatchStrategy} in its <em>own</em> {@code
 * applyPrior()}, so TinkerPop's topological sort runs this strategy first and the
 * half-measures become the decline fallback. Those half-measure {@code applyPrior()} edits and
 * the registration into the optimization chain are in place — see {@code YTDBGraphImplAbstract}
 * and each half-measure strategy's {@code applyPrior()}; this strategy only declares its own
 * (empty) ordering constraints.
 *
 * <h2>Plan caching</h2>
 *
 * Cache-eligible walks build through {@link GremlinPlanCache}, keyed by {@link
 * GremlinPlanFingerprint} on the post-walk {@link MatchPlanInputs}. A second map, keyed by
 * {@link GremlinStepWalker#extractShape} (the production recognisers' {@code contributeShape}
 * tokens plus this invocation's {@code ?} bindings), stores {@link GremlinTranslationTemplate}:
 * a hit skips the walker entirely (splice from the stored template, or return immediately on a
 * cached decline). An extraction that cannot prove completeness never reads or writes that map.
 * RID-bearing shapes ({@code g.V(ids)}, {@code hasId(...)}) bypass both caches.
 * Per-walk predicate values bind as positional parameters and are installed on the boundary step
 * at execution time. A plan is stored only when no metadata invalidation landed after the
 * {@code planningStart} captured before the walk, so a concurrent schema change during translation
 * never leaves a stale plan in the shared per-database cache — the same guard
 * {@code MatchExecutionPlanner} applies for the YQL/GQL plan cache. Cache-backed single-plan
 * steps copy the stored template on first open rather than during {@code apply}.
 *
 * <h2>Translation telemetry</h2>
 *
 * Outcomes that reach a translation attempt feed {@link GremlinTranslationMetrics} on the
 * database {@code SharedContext}: successes, declines (unsupported shape, edge / non-vertex start,
 * repeat veto, or cached decline), and throw-safety-net errors. Each recording also updates the
 * matching {@link com.jetbrains.youtrackdb.internal.common.profiler.metrics.CoreMetrics} success /
 * decline / error {@code Ratio} metrics. Declined shapes are retained (bounded) so operators can
 * ask which unsupported step lists dominate. Kill-switch / missing session and idempotent
 * re-applies (boundary already present) are not attempts — those are not coverage failures.
 *
 * <h2>Testability</h2>
 *
 * The translator and plan builder are injected as the {@link TraversalTranslator} and {@link
 * MatchPlanBuilder} seams through package-private constructors, so unit tests can drive the
 * post-gate splice path with a fixture {@link GremlinToMatchTranslator.TranslationResult} (and
 * can supply a throwing fixture to exercise the throw-safety net) without wiring a real walker.
 * Production code uses {@link #instance()}, which wires the production facade.
