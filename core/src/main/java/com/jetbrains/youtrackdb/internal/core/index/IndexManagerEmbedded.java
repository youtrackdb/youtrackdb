 * (de)serializing or deleting the classless index-manager and per-index records — and, on the
 * legacy drop path, batched deletions on a copied session), and any record work can reach a fresh
 * schema-read acquisition frames down (a snapshot rebuild inside record (de)serialization whenever
 * the shared snapshot cache was concurrently invalidated). Taking this lock first and the schema
 * lock later inverts the order and ABBA-deadlocks against a schema-carrying commit, which holds
 * the schema write lock while acquiring this lock. {@link #acquireExclusiveLock} therefore takes
 * the committed schema READ lock before this lock and holds it for the whole region
 * ({@link #releaseExclusiveLock} releases it after this lock): while the region runs, every nested
 * schema-lock acquisition on this thread — at any depth, on any session — is reentrant and
 * non-blocking, and the committed schema cannot change under the region (promotion requires the
 * schema write lock), so the region never operates on a snapshot that goes stale mid-flight.
 * The order is enforced at runtime by the schema lock's lock-order guard
