   * child's steps to top level before the translator runs, so the walker sees them as top-level
   * steps and the latch classifies them correctly without special-casing.)
   *
   * <p>The union fork is the second child path and it does not go through a sub-walk.
   * {@code UnionForkHostImpl.walkFork} re-enters the top-level {@link GremlinStepWalker#walk} with a

   * <p>Both simpler alternatives answer wrongly. Swallowing the append the way {@link
   * SubTraversalPredicateAdapter} swallows {@link #setResultShaping} lets the child's terminator
   * accept while its stage is dropped, which changes the child's truth value. Take
   * {@code g.V().not(__.out().fold())}: natively the {@code fold()} makes the child emit one result
   * for every vertex — a dry upstream still emits one empty list — so the {@code not} rejects every
   * vertex and the query returns nothing. With the append swallowed the child is a plain
   * edge-bearing hop, {@link NotStepRecogniser} translates it as a detached anti-join, and every
   * vertex with no outgoing edge comes back. Which way the row set moves depends on the combinator —
   * the same swallow under {@code and} / {@code where} loses rows where this {@code not} gains
   * them — so the terminator has to learn it cannot contribute and decline the whole walk. Throwing
   * out of the append (the shape {@link #appendPostConcatOp} uses) lands in
   * {@link GremlinToMatchStrategy}'s {@code RuntimeException} net, which degrades it to a silent
   * decline minus the diagnostic.
