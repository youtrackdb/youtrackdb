/**
 * Recogniser for {@link UnfoldStep}: {@code unfold()} registers a per-payload flat-map
 * {@link ListShapingOp} that expands each projected payload into the payloads it contains. The
 * contribution is one append and nothing else — no RETURN column, no clause, no boundary re-pin — so
 * the stage expands whatever the preceding step projected, and the five shapes it distinguishes are
 * {@link UnfoldListShapingOp}'s business rather than this recogniser's.
 *
 * <h2>Per-payload, so another stage may follow</h2>
 *
 * A flat-map is one more stage on the payload stream rather than a clause on the statement, and it
 * neither drains nor windows that stream, so {@link GremlinStepWalker} admits a further stage behind
 * it: {@code unfold().reverse()} and {@code unfold().fold()} translate. What may not follow is any step
 * whose contribution rides the assembled statement — MATCH applies the statement as the plan runs,
 * strictly before the boundary base applies these stages, so {@code unfold().dedup()} would emit
 * {@code RETURN DISTINCT} over the rows the expansion was meant to consume. That gate is the walker's
 * dispatch loop rather than a check here, and it covers the recognisers written after this one too;
 * {@code GremlinStepWalker.capturedListShapingOp} and
 * {@code GremlinStepWalker.LIST_SHAPING_PER_PAYLOAD_RECOGNISERS} carry the rule and the memberships.
 *
 * <h2>Post-union, the stage runs once over the concatenation</h2>
 *
 * {@code union(...).unfold()} translates. A per-payload stage over the concatenation and the same
 * stage applied to each arm's payloads produce the same multiset, so the one ordering fact the
 * multi-plan boundary and native disagree about — which arm's rows arrive first — cannot reach the
 * answer. That is why this recogniser sits on {@code GremlinStepWalker.POST_UNION_RECOGNISERS} and
 * answers {@link #selectsPositionally} {@code false}; the field's javadoc carries the comparison
 * against the members that answer {@code true}.
 *
 * <p>The remaining decline is the cardinality gate's rather than this recogniser's: an
 * {@code unfold} behind a captured {@code SKIP} / {@code LIMIT} / {@code RETURN DISTINCT} declines
 * there.
 *
 * <p>The one decline this recogniser owns is the combinator channel: a child sub-walk answers
 * {@link RecognitionContext#supportsListShaping()} {@code false}, because its payloads never reach a
 * boundary and a swallowed append would change the child's truth value. That method's javadoc carries
 * the worked case.
