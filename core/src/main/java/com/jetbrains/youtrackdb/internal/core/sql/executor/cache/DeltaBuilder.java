/**
 * Builds the {@link TxDeltaCursor} that reconciles a {@link CachedEntry}'s frozen RECORD output
 * against the in-transaction mutations that landed after the entry was populated. Stateless: every
 * method takes the entry, the transaction, and the original query's command context, so a single
 * shared instance (or static use) serves all entries.
 *
 * <p><b>Populate-version filter.</b> Only mutations whose {@link RecordOperation#version}
 * exceeds {@link CachedEntry#getPopulateMutationVersion()} enter the build. Every earlier mutation is
 * already reflected in {@link CachedEntry#getResults()} by the transaction-aware executor that
 * populated the entry, so replaying it here would double-apply it. Because {@code
 * addRecordOperation} re-stamps {@code version} to the latest mutation on its collapse path, a single
 * collapsed operation carries the version of its most recent change; the filter therefore admits a
 * collapsed pre-populate record exactly when a post-populate mutation touched it.
 *
 * <p><b>Dispatch table.</b> For each surviving operation the build computes two runtime facts —
 * {@code cached_at_build} (was the RID already pulled into {@link CachedEntry#getCachedRids()}?) and
 * {@code match_after} (does the post-mutation record still satisfy the WHERE clause, re-evaluated
 * with the original query's context so {@code :param} bindings resolve identically?) — then dispatches
 * on {@code (op.type, cached_at_build, match_after)}:
 *
 * <pre>
 *   op.type   cached  match  action
 *   CREATED   true    true   skip + inject  (collapsed pre-populate row whose ORDER BY key may have moved)
 *   CREATED   true    false  skip           (collapsed update drove WHERE false; drop the cached row)
 *   CREATED   false   true   inject         (true post-populate create; never in cache)
 *   CREATED   false   false  no-op          (true post-populate create that does not match)
 *   UPDATED   true    true   skip + inject  (re-position in case the ORDER BY key changed)
 *   UPDATED   true    false  skip           (no longer matches WHERE; remove from result)
 *   UPDATED   false   true   skip + inject  (not yet stream-pulled; inject post-mutation, suppress stale pull)
 *   UPDATED   false   false  skip           (suppress later stream-pull of the pre-mutation state)
 *   DELETED   *       *      skip           (suppress both the cache cursor and the stream pull)
 * </pre>
 *
 * <p>The collapse semantics make {@code cached_at_build} load-bearing even under the version filter:
 * {@code addRecordOperation} keeps a CREATE→UPDATE collapsed operation typed {@code CREATED} while
 * bumping its version, so a {@code CREATED} operation can be either a true post-populate create
 * (never in cache) or a pre-populate create whose post-populate update re-stamped it (in cache from
 * populate). {@code cached_at_build} is the runtime distinguisher: same type, different cache state,
 * different action. CREATE→DELETE and UPDATE→DELETE both collapse to {@code DELETED}, which always
 * skips regardless of the other two facts.
 *
 * <p><b>Cross-view sharing.</b> The {@code (skipSet, injectList)} pair is a pure function of the
 * entry's frozen metadata and the transaction's current mutation state, so two views built on one
 * entry at the same {@link FrontendTransactionImpl#getMutationVersion()} compute the identical pair.
 * The build caches the latest pair on the entry tagged by that version and reuses it when a later view
 * observes the same version, avoiding a re-walk of the mutation log. A view at a fresher version
 * rebuilds and overwrites the cached pair; older views keep their own reference to the prior pair via
 * their cursor, so the prior pair stays correct until those views finish.
 *
 * <p>Single-transaction state observed only by the owning thread; no synchronisation.
