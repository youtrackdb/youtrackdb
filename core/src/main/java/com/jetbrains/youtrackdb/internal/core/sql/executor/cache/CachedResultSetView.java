/**
 * The consumer-facing {@link ResultSet} a cached {@code query()} returns. It reconstructs the rows a
 * fresh uncached execution would emit by merging a {@link CachedEntry}'s frozen output
 * with the in-transaction mutations the {@link DeltaBuilder} captured into a {@link TxDeltaCursor},
 * without ever re-running storage.
 *
 * <p><b>RECORD path (sorted-merge).</b> {@link #next()} merges two cursors: the positional
 * <i>cache cursor</i> (a per-view index into the entry's lazily-grown {@link CachedEntry#getResults()})
 * and the per-view <i>delta cursor</i> ({@link TxDeltaCursor}). Each step drops any cache row whose RID
 * the delta marks for skip (DELETED or re-positioned), materializes the next storage row from the
 * shared paused stream when the cached prefix is exhausted but the stream is not (so a delta inject can
 * never be emitted ahead of a not-yet-pulled storage row that sorts earlier), then emits whichever of
 * the two heads sorts smaller per the entry's ORDER BY. Ties favour the inject side, which keeps a
 * mutated row at-or-before an equally-ranked cached row; either choice is correct because a tie can
 * only occur between distinct RIDs (a skip on the cache head was already consumed).
 *
 * <p><b>K0_NONE path (direct replay).</b> A K0_NONE entry carries no delta cursor: the lookup-time
 * mutation-version gate already guaranteed no post-populate mutation, so there is nothing to merge. The
 * view replays {@link CachedEntry#getResults()} directly, lazy-pulling the stream tail with no skip-set
 * filtering, exactly as a non-cached re-run of that deterministic plan would.
 *
 * <p><b>Aggregate path (single scalar row).</b> An {@code AGGREGATE_*} entry carries no cache cursor
 * and no stream to pull: the side-tap already drove the populating plan to exhaustion at cache-put, so
 * the per-RID material lives entirely in the entry's {@link AggregateState}. The view carries the
 * replayed delta copy ({@link DeltaBuilder#buildForAggregate}) and emits at most one row, {@link
 * AggregateState#toResult}, then drains. {@code hasNext()} is true at most once: a value aggregate
 * (SUM/AVG/MIN/MAX) over an empty contributor set emits no row, matching fresh execution.
 *
 * <p><b>Stream-pull unification.</b> Both paths share one {@link #pullOneFromStream} helper. On the
 * RECORD path it drops any pulled row whose RID is in the delta skip-set (closing the lazy-pull gap:
 * a mutated RID living beyond the cached prefix must not surface from storage with stale state); on the
 * K0_NONE path the skip-set is empty so nothing is dropped. Pulled rows are appended to the shared
 * {@code entry.results} / {@code cachedRids} so later views replay the full ordered result — except
 * after a single-view per-entry overflow, when the entry switches to relay ({@link
 * CachedEntry#isRelayMode()}): buffering stops and the sole view takes its RECORD cache head from
 * {@link #relayCacheHead} (the K0_NONE path returns the pulled row directly).
 *
 * <p><b>View pinning.</b> The constructor increments {@link CachedEntry#getLiveViewCount()} and
 * {@link #close()} (or natural exhaustion) decrements it exactly once, pinning the entry against LRU
 * eviction while this view iterates so a mid-iteration view never loses rows.
 *
 * <p><b>Re-entrancy guard coverage.</b> The session opens the transaction's cache-code guard
 * ({@code FrontendTransactionImpl.enterCacheCode()}) around the synchronous lookup. The view then
 * re-enters that guard for each row-production window (inside {@link #hasNext()} around {@link
 * #computeNext}): lazy stream pulls, delta merge, and MATCH RETURN projection can evaluate a UDF that
 * issues a nested {@code query()}, which must bypass the cache (depth &gt; 0) while that row is being
 * produced. The guard is released immediately after the row is computed, so a user-issued {@code
 * query()} between two {@link #next()} calls still uses the cache, and an abandoned view does not hold
 * the guard indefinitely.
 *
 * <p><b>Idempotent close.</b> {@link #close()} is a no-op after the first call and releases the pin
 * (the entry's live-view count) exactly once. It does not touch the cache-code guard, which is held
 * only per row inside {@link #hasNext()} (see above), never across the view's lifetime. The view never closes the entry's shared stream itself: the
 * stream is owned by the {@link CachedEntry} (closed at tx-end cache clear) and possibly other views,
 * so closing it here would truncate them.
 *
 * <p>Single-transaction state observed only by the owning thread; no field is synchronised.

  /**
   * Releases the entry's live-view pin exactly once across {@link #close()} and natural exhaustion, so
   * an iterated-to-exhaustion or explicitly-closed view stops blocking LRU eviction. Idempotent. The
   * cache-code re-entrancy guard is not touched here: it is entered and exited per row in
   * {@link #hasNext()}, never held across the view's lifetime, so there is nothing to release at pin
   * time — and the pool-shutdown close path (which may run cross-thread) decrements only the pin, a
   * floored no-op that does not assert the owning thread.
   *
   * <p><b>Abandoned views.</b> A view dropped without {@code close()} and without being iterated to
   * exhaustion never reaches either release site, so its pin stays held and its entry stays exempt from
   * LRU eviction. This is bounded by the transaction's lifetime, not a leak across transactions:
   * {@code FrontendTransactionImpl.clear()} (every tx-end path) calls {@code QueryResultCache.clear()},
   * which closes every entry regardless of pin count — including an entry the cache already detached
   * while pinned (invalidate / TRUNCATE / overflow), caught through the cache's {@code closePending}
   * set, so an abandoned view never leaks its stream even after the entry left the map. The only effect
   * is that one long transaction with
   * many abandoned, partially-consumed views can hold its cache transiently over {@code maxEntries}.
   * Acceptable for v1: ResultSets are expected to be closed or drained, so abandonment is the
   * exceptional path; tying the pin to a phantom-reference cleaner would be the lever if a long-tx
   * over-bound regression ever shows up.
