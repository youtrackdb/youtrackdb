/**
 * Base class for all storage-backed data structures that participate in the page cache lifecycle.
 * Durable components have their state restored from WAL after a crash; non-durable components are
 * deleted on crash recovery and recreated on next open.
 *
 * <h2>Cross-transaction discovery contract</h2>
 *
 * <p>Storage components must answer "is this page already on disk?" without leaking the cache's
 * in-flight allocation state across transactions. The convention enforced from this class:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Logical surface (preferred).</b> A component that owns an {@code EntryPoint} metadata
 *       page reads cross-transaction page-existence facts from {@code entryPoint.pagesSize} /
 *       {@code entryPoint.fileSize}. These counters advance only inside the same WAL atomic unit
 *       that performed the corresponding allocator call, so they are durably ordered with the
 *       allocator's effect — no in-flight {@code pageIndex} can leak.</li>
 *   <li><b>Physical surface (gated).</b> Where no {@code EntryPoint} exists or the call is a
 *       bootstrap / recovery-rebuild / defensive-probe shape that pre-dates the logical surface,
 *       physical-size reads from inside a {@code StorageComponent} route through
 *       {@link #physicalSize(AtomicOperation, long, PhysicalReadIntent)}. The intent argument is
 *       unused at runtime; it exists as an audit-grep anchor so the surviving consumer set stays
 *       enumerable. Direct calls to {@code WriteCache.getFilledUpTo} from storage components are
 *       not on the public discovery path.</li>
 * </ul>
 *
 * <p>The backup-snapshot iterator on the cache layer has its own named entry point
 * ({@code WriteCache.physicalSizeForBackupSnapshot}); it is a parallel gated surface for the one
 * call site that reads physical size outside any {@code StorageComponent}.

   * logical horizon (the partial-flush "orphan" pages that survive a crash between an
   * allocator-only physical extend and the corresponding logical-counter advance).
   *
   * <p>The {@code max(pageSize, ...)} floor preserves the EP page itself on the fresh-component
   * branch ({@code logicalPages == 0}): a healthy CPMV2 or PCV2 computes a target of
   * {@code 1 * pageSize}, which keeps the EP / state page and is a no-op against current
   * physical state. For BTree / SLBB whose {@code init()} sets the counter to {@code 1}, the
   * floor only matters defensively against the corruption shape ruled out by the guard below.
   *
   * <p>Corruption guard: if {@code logicalPages == 0} AND physical bytes exceed one EP page,
   * the pass skips the truncate with a WARN log rather than mask the inconsistency. The
   * combination covers two distinct shapes:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>(a) a true {@code logical < physical} corruption shape that WAL replay is supposed
   *       to prevent — operators handle this through the storage-corruption runbook;</li>
   *   <li>(b) a fresh-create + partial-flush-orphan case: a brand-new component whose
   *       {@code create()} bumped physical via an allocation that reached AsyncFile but
   *       crashed before the commit landed on disk, so the EP counter is still its initial
   *       0 while physical now holds the partial-flushed orphan tail. The escape valve is
   *       the allocator-only {@code op.loadOrAddPageForWrite} contract — the next allocation
   *       observes the physical orphan via the {@code op.filledUpTo > knownIndex} check and
   *       throws {@code IllegalStateException} loudly, surfacing the issue at first write
   *       rather than silently absorbing it.</li>
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Both shapes are handled identically here: skip-with-WARN, leaving the truncate for
   * operator review. Asymmetry note: BTree / SLBB EPs {@code init()} their counter to
   * {@code 1}, so {@code logicalPages == 0} is itself anomalous; CPMV2 / PCV2 EPs
   * {@code init()} their counter to {@code 0}, which is the legitimate post-create state — the
   * {@code physicalBytes > pageSize} second clause is what discriminates a healthy fresh
   * CPMV2 / PCV2 (physical == {@code pageSize}, one EP page only) from a real
   * {@code logical < physical} shape.
   *
   * <p>EP-read failures (e.g., a corrupted EP page surfaced by
   * {@code checksumMode=StoreAndThrow}) propagate the {@link IOException} through this
   * method and abort the enclosing {@code open()} / incremental-restore flow. This is
   * intentional: without the EP we cannot compute the truncate target, and silently skipping
   * the component would re-introduce the partial-flush-orphan path the pass exists to fix.
   *
   * <p>After the primary truncate dispatches, {@link #verifyAndTruncateOrphansSiblings} runs
   * so components with embedded sibling files (PCV2's embedded CPM is the only current case)

   * belt-and-braces hardening for the apply-phase epoch (YTDB-1178). The historical failure
   * mode this guards against is a <em>false null</em>: an optimistic B-tree descent composing
   * a per-page-valid but mutually inconsistent view and concluding "absent" for a present
   * key. The epoch closes that race; this re-check is an independent second line of defense
   * plus a live detector for any unmodeled anomaly.
   *
   * <p>Decision rules:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>The re-check triggers ONLY when the optimistic attempt completed cleanly (per-page
   *       stamps AND epoch both validated) and {@code recheckTrigger} accepts the result
   *       (typically: the lookup came back null). It NEVER triggers after the pinned fallback
   *       ran — the fallback's result is already authoritative, and re-checking it would make
   *       every legitimate miss pay the pinned cost twice more.
   *   <li>On trigger, the pinned lambda runs once under the component shared lock. A non-null
   *       pinned result that differs from the optimistic one is a disagreement: a rate-limited
   *       ERROR is emitted and the pinned result is returned. If the pinned result is null too,
   *       the null is confirmed and returned silently.
   *   <li>The trigger fires only on the load-bearing NULL by design: stale validated
   *       NON-null results are guaranteed consistent by the apply-phase epoch, and
   *       re-verifying them would double the pinned cost of every successful lookup.
   * </ul>
   *
   * @param recheckTrigger    evaluated on the validated optimistic result; return true to
   *                          request the pinned re-check (e.g. {@code Objects::isNull}, or a
   *                          flag captured from an inner lookup when the composed result can
   *                          mask the load-bearing null)
