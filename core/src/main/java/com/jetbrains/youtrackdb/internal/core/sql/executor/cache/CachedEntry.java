/**
 * One slot of the transaction result cache: the frozen output of a single populated query plus the
 * AST metadata the delta builder needs to reconcile that output against later in-transaction
 * mutations.
 *
 * <p><b>Lazy populate.</b> An entry is created at cache-miss time wrapping the live {@link
 * ExecutionStream} (already wrapped in an {@link IdempotentExecutionStream} by the cache) together
 * with its plan and context. {@link #results} grows lazily as views pull rows: the first view that
 * needs a tail row drives the stream one step, appends the row to {@link #results}, and records its
 * RID in {@link #cachedRids}; later views replay from the list. When the stream reports no more rows,
 * the entry flips {@link #exhausted}, closes the stream, and from then on every view is a pure list
 * replay.
 *
 * <p><b>Version anchor.</b> {@link #populateMutationVersion} is the transaction's mutation version at
 * the instant the populating execution began. The delta builder considers only mutations whose
 * version exceeds it, because every earlier mutation is already reflected in {@link #results} by the
 * transaction-aware executor.
 *
 * <p><b>Cross-view delta sharing.</b> Two views built on this entry at the same transaction mutation
 * version compute the identical {@code (skipSet, injectList)} delta. The entry caches the latest such
 * pair ({@link #cachedSkipSet} / {@link #cachedInjectList} tagged by {@link #cachedDeltaVersion}) so
 * a second view at the same version reuses it instead of re-walking the mutation log. The cached pair
 * is overwritten when a view at a fresher version triggers a rebuild; older views keep their own
 * reference to the prior pair until they are done. These fields are written by the delta builder
 * ({@link DeltaBuilder#buildForRecord}) at view-build time; this foundation establishes their storage
 * and the entry lifecycle.
 *
 * <p><b>Idempotent close.</b> {@link #close} closes the stream and then the plan, null-guarding and
 * early-returning on a second call. The entry is the sole closer of both today: the consumer-facing
 * {@link CachedResultSetView} never closes the shared stream, and the populating {@code
 * LocalResultSet} whose stream this entry adopted is orphaned (never registered in the session's
 * active-query set), so its own close never runs. The stream is still wrapped in an {@link
 * IdempotentExecutionStream} as a defensive guard against a future second owner.
 *
 * <p>Single-transaction state observed only by the owning thread; no field is synchronised.
