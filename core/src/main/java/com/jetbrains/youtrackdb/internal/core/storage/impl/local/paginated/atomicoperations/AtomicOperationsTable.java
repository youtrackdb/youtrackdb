/// A concurrent transaction tracking table for implementing Snapshot Isolation (SI).
///
/// This class maintains the lifecycle state of atomic operations (transactions) and provides
/// visibility decisions for concurrent read operations. It is a core component of the SI
/// implementation, enabling readers to determine which record versions are visible based on
/// transaction timestamps.
///
/// ## Functionality
///
/// - **Lifecycle tracking**: Tracks operations through state transitions:
///   `NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS → COMMITTED → PERSISTED` or
///   `NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS → ROLLED_BACK`
/// - **Snapshot visibility**: Creates consistent snapshots of in-progress transactions
///   for determining record version visibility
/// - **WAL segment management**: Identifies earliest segments with active or unpersisted
///   operations to support write-ahead log truncation
/// - **Memory management**: Periodic compaction removes completed entries
///
/// ## Design
///
/// The table uses a single contiguous [CASObjectArray] covering a range of timestamps
/// starting from [#tsOffset]. This enables O(1) index calculation:
/// `itemIndex = operationTs - tsOffset`.
///
/// **Concurrency model**:
/// - Individual status updates use lock-free CAS operations within the table
/// - Shared lock is held during reads and status changes (allows concurrency)
/// - Exclusive lock is acquired only during structural changes (compaction)
///
/// ## Thread Safety
///
/// This class is thread-safe. All public methods can be called concurrently from multiple
/// threads. The implementation uses a combination of [ScalableRWLock] for structural
/// protection and [CASObjectArray] for lock-free element updates.
