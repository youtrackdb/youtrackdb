/**
 * Multi-plan boundary step: the concrete {@link AbstractMatchPlanStep} that concatenates the result
 * streams of N compiled MATCH plans, one per {@code union(...)} child. The Gremlin-to-MATCH strategy
 * builds this step when a recognised traversal translates to a {@code union} whose children each
 * become their own {@link SelectExecutionPlan}; the shared open / drain / close lifecycle and the
 * row projection live in the base, and this class supplies the N plans through the plan-seam hooks.
 *
 * <h2>Concatenation, not cartesian product</h2>
 * The children are concatenated: {@code union(c1, …, cN)} emits every row of {@code c1}, then every
 * row of {@code c2}, and so on, so the result multiset is {@code |c1| + … + |cN|}. This is the
 * opposite of MATCH's {@code splitDisjointPatterns}, which joins disconnected patterns by cartesian
 * product; union must therefore build one full plan per child and concatenate rather than ride a
 * single multi-pattern MATCH.
 *
 * <h2>One live stream at a time</h2>
 * {@link #startPlanStream()} realizes the base's single-stream hook as one {@link
 * MultipleExecutionStream} over an {@link ExecutionStreamProducer} that opens each child plan
 * <em>lazily</em>: child {@code i+1} is opened only after child {@code i} has drained and been
 * closed. Two consequences fall out of that laziness for free:
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Exception stops the advance.</b> A failure while iterating child {@code i} propagates up
 *       through the concatenator into the base's {@link #processNextStart()} terminal handler before
 *       child {@code i+1} is ever opened — so the children after the failing one never start.
 *   <li><b>Bounded footprint.</b> Only one child plan holds an open stream at any instant; the base
 *       projects the concatenation as if it were one stream, so row projection and the ordered
 *       list-shaping post-process apply once over the whole union (this is what lets a later {@code
 *       union().fold()} fold the whole union into one list rather than one list per child).
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>Post-concatenation reductions</h2>
 * A recognised {@code count()}, {@code limit()} / {@code range()} / {@code skip()}, or {@code
 * dedup()} following the union arrives as an ordered {@link PostConcatOp} list, and {@link
 * #startPlanStream()} may therefore return something other than the plain concatenator. There are
 * two count paths. A <em>lone</em> {@code Count} is pushed down: the strategy rewrote every child to
 * {@code RETURN count(*)} at build time, so {@link #sumChildCountStreams()} opens each child, reads
 * its one scalar row, and emits a single summed {@code count} column without ever materialising the
 * element concatenation. Any other op list keeps the children on elements and wraps the
 * concatenator with the {@link PostConcatStreams} decorators, applying the ops in recognised order —
 * a skip counter, a limit that early-stops the concatenator so later children never open, a global
 * identity set for {@code dedup}, and a terminal drain-and-count for a {@code Count} that follows
 * another reduction. Order matters, so the wrapping follows the list rather than a fixed
 * precedence: {@code union(…).limit(5).count()}
 * counts at most five rows, which is what the recogniser accepted.
 *
 * <h2>Per-child isolated, session-rebound context</h2>
 * Each child plan carries its own {@link CommandContext} (with its own positional parameters,
 * installed at build time — the base's shared parameter map is deliberately empty here). The base
 * rebinds the coordinator context ({@link #planContext()}) to the iteration-thread session in {@code
 * openArming()}; the producer reads that session back and rebinds each child's own context before
 * opening it, then iterates and closes the child stream against that child's own context via {@link
 * ChildContextStream}. Each child therefore executes exactly as it would under the single-plan
 * {@link YTDBMatchPlanStep} — start-time context and iteration-time context are the same, so a step
 * that resolves the session or reads {@code $current} / {@code $matched} at iteration time (e.g.
 * {@code LoaderExecutionStream}) never sees its state split across two contexts. No edit to {@link
 * AbstractMatchPlanStep} is needed: pre-binding each child stream this way is sufficient.
 *
 * <h2>Close-all, including un-run children</h2>
 * {@link #closePlan()} closes <em>every</em> child plan, not only those the producer opened. When an
 * exception stops the advance at child {@code i}, children {@code i+1 …} were never started but their
 * step chains still exist and must be released; closing an un-run {@link SelectExecutionPlan} is safe
 * (its close simply propagates backward through an unstarted chain). A single child's close failure
 * never masks the others — the first failure stays primary and the rest attach with {@code
 * addSuppressed}.
 *
 * <h2>Clone</h2>
 * {@link #clone()} gives the clone its own deep copy of <em>each</em> child plan against its own
 * isolated child context, mirroring {@link YTDBMatchPlanStep#clone()} per child. Union's multi-alias
 * children make cross-execution context bleed a real hazard (each child owns unsynchronised {@code
 * $current} / {@code $matched} / statistics maps), so every child is isolated independently. The
 * clone also gets a fresh coordinator context so two concurrent clones never race on the coordinator.
 *
 * @param <S> upstream traverser type (always {@code Object} for a start step)
 * @param <E> emitted payload type ({@link Vertex} for {@link BoundaryOutputType#ELEMENT}; Map /
 *            scalar / value for the other output types — the Element bound is historical for the
 *            ELEMENT path and is unchecked-cast for non-element payloads)
