/**
 * <h1>Scalable Read-Write Lock </h1>
 * <p>
 * A Read-Write Lock that is scalable with the number of threads doing Read. Uses a
 * two-state-machine for the Readers, and averages two synchronized operations. <br> Although this
 * mechanism was independently designed and implemented by the authors, the idea is very similar to
 * the algorithm C-RW-WP described in this paper: <a
 * href="http://blogs.oracle.com/dave/resource/ppopp13-dice-NUMAAwareRWLocks.pdf">NUMA-Aware
 * Reader-Writer locks</a> <br> Relative to the paper, there are two differences: The threads have
 * no particular order, which means this implementation is <b>not</b> NUMA-aware; Threads attempting
 * a read-lock for the first time are added to a list and removed when the thread terminates,
 * following the mechanism described below. To manage the adding and removal of new Reader threads,
 * we use a ConcurrentLinkedQueue instance named {@code readersStateList} containing all the
 * references to ReadersEntry (Reader's states), which the Writer scans to determine if the Readers
 * have completed or not. After a thread terminates and its {@code ReadersEntry} becomes
 * unreachable, a {@link Cleaner} action removes the Reader's state reference from the
 * {@code readersStateList}, to avoid memory leaking. Advantages:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Implements {@code java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock}
 *   <li>When there are very few Writes, the performance scales with the number of Reader threads
 *   <li>No need to call initialization/cleanup functions per thread
 *   <li>No limitation on the number of concurrent threads
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Disadvantages:
 *
 * <ul>
 *   <li>Not Reentrant
 *   <li>Has Writer-Preference
 *   <li>Memory footprint increases with number of threads by sizeof(ReadersEntry) x O(N_threads)
 *   <li>Does not support {@code lockInterruptibly()}
 *   <li>Does not support {@code newCondition()}
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * For scenarios with few writes, the average case for {@code sharedLock()} is two synchronized
 * calls: an {@code AtomicInteger.set()} on a cache line that is held in exclusive mode by the core
 * where the current thread is running, and an {@code AtomicLong.get()} on a shared cache line.<br>
 * This means that when doing several sequential calls of sharedLock()/unlock() on the same
 * instance, the performance penalty will be small because the accessed variables will most likely
 * be in L1/L2 cache.

  /**
   * Acquires the write lock ONCE with an abort predicate, for a waiter that must give way to an

   * contention alone.
   *
   * <p>The two-guarantee contract this primitive exists for (both load-bearing for the freezer
   * gate's third checkpoint; see the correctness comments inline):
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li><b>Bounded acquisition under sustained readers.</b> The write bit is acquired exactly
   *       once and then HELD through the reader drain — writer preference: from the moment the
   *       bit is set, new readers observe {@code isWriteLocked()} and back off exactly as they do
   *       against {@link #exclusiveLock()}. There is no inter-attempt release window (unlike an
   *       {@link #exclusiveTryLockNanos} retry loop, which releases the bit on every drain
   *       timeout and forfeits admission to slip-in readers), so the acquisition completes within
   *       the maximum residual reader residence — deterministic, no starvation, no retry storm.
   *   <li><b>Abort within one poll granularity.</b> The predicate is polled between phase-1
   *       {@code tryWriteLock} attempts (each bounded by {@code pollNanos}) and on every yield
   *       iteration of the phase-2 reader-drain spin (the tightest granularity available; the
   *       intended predicate is a single atomic-counter read, so per-iteration polling costs
   *       less than the yield beside it). On abort the write bit is released fully — no queue
   *       entry, no held bit, no residual writer-intent state — so no reader or writer is
   *       stranded (parked readers spin on {@code isWriteLocked()} and proceed; there is no
   *       wait/notify channel to lose a wakeup on) and the primitive is immediately reusable.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>The predicate is additionally re-checked immediately after the drain completes (which is
   * also immediately after bit acquisition when there are no residual readers to drain), BEFORE
   * returning {@code true}: a condition arriving exactly at the acquisition-success edge aborts
   * here rather than being missed and caught only by later downstream gates with the lock held.
   *
   * <p>No new deadlock edge: the method blocks only on the same two waits {@link #exclusiveLock()}
   * already performs (the stamped writer queue and the reader-drain spin), both now bounded by the
   * abort predicate; the abort path releases everything before returning, and a queued phase-1
   * candidate holds nothing at all (readers never consult the stamped writer queue — they poll
   * only {@code isWriteLocked()}).
   *
   * <p>Interruption: an interrupt while parked in the phase-1 timed acquire restores the interrupt
   * flag and throws {@link DatabaseException} naming the lock state. The phase-2 drain is a yield
   * spin, uninterruptible exactly like {@link #exclusiveLock()}'s.
   *
   * <p>All other methods of this class are byte-for-byte unaffected; readers pay nothing new.
   *
   * <p>Fairness note: a phase-1 timeout re-enters the stamped writer queue at its tail, so under
   * sustained contention from plain {@link #exclusiveLock()} writers this waiter can lose its
   * queue position once per {@code pollNanos} — phase 1 is unbounded in theory under a permanent
   * writer storm. Acceptable for the intended consumer (storage state locks have rare, short
   * writers); a fairness-sensitive consumer would need a different phase-1 shape.
   *
   * <p>A predicate that THROWS is propagated — but never with the write bit held: a phase-1 throw
   * happens with nothing acquired, and the phase-2 evaluation sites are guarded so the bit is
   * released before the failure escapes (an ownerless write bit would wedge every reader and
   * writer of this lock forever).
   *
