/**
 * Shared base for the boundary steps that bridge a compiled YTDB MATCH plan to TinkerPop's
 * traverser-driven iteration. When the Gremlin-to-MATCH strategy recognises a traversal end-to-end
 * it replaces the entire step list with a single boundary step; translation is all-or-nothing, so a
 * boundary step is always the traversal's only step.
 *
 * <p>This base owns the parts that are the same whether the boundary reads one plan or several: the
 * single-{@link ExecutionStream} open / drain / close primitives, the per-arming row projection (the
 * graph is injected per arming, never captured at construction, so a re-armed or cloned step always
 * projects against the graph resolved for the current pass), the {@link ResultShaping} read, and
 * {@link AutoCloseable}. The single-vs-N-plan orchestration — which plan(s) supply the stream, how
 * the plan is rewound, and how the plan(s) are closed — is delegated to the concrete subclasses
 * through the {@link #planContext()} / {@link #rewindPlan(CommandContext)} / {@link
 * #startPlanStream()} / {@link #closePlan()} hooks. {@code YTDBMatchPlanStep} is the single-plan
 * concrete form; a multi-plan form reuses the same lifecycle without re-implementing it.
 *
 * <p>The step extends {@link AbstractStep} directly, mirroring the fork's own element-emitting start
 * steps ({@code AddVertexStartStep}, {@code AddEdgeStartStep}). It is deliberately <em>not</em> a
 * {@code GraphStep}: it carries none of that class's id / has-container / {@code Configuring}
 * surface, and staying off the {@code GraphStep} hierarchy keeps {@code YTDBGraphStepStrategy}'s
 * rebuild loop from ever folding the boundary into a {@code YTDBGraphStep}.
 *
 * <h2>Lifecycle</h2>
 * <ul>
 *   <li><b>Construction:</b> the strategy builds the plan and constructs the step. No execution
 *       work runs yet.
 *   <li><b>Iteration:</b> the first {@link #processNextStart()} opens the plan's {@link
 *       ExecutionStream} via {@link #openArming()}. It rebinds the plan's context to the session
 *       active on the current (iteration) thread first — the plan may have been compiled on a
 *       different thread, and YTDB record reads require the session active on the reading thread.
 *       Each subsequent call pulls one {@link Result} row, projects it per {@link
 *       BoundaryOutputType}, and generates a traverser. Wrapping goes through {@link YTDBVertexImpl}
 *       so downstream native steps see TinkerPop element types.
 *   <li><b>Exhaustion:</b> when the stream runs dry the arming's <em>stream</em> is closed but the
 *       plan is kept open, so a {@link #reset()} + reopen can rewind and re-run it — a closed {@link
 *       SelectExecutionPlan} cannot be restarted at all (its steps' close guard is sticky), which is
 *       why re-arming from a closed plan has to copy it instead of rewinding it (see {@link
 *       #replaceClosedPlanWithCopy()}). The plan itself is closed by the {@link #close()} TinkerPop
 *       fires on exhaustion (via {@code DefaultTraversal.hasNext()} closing the traversal through
 *       {@code CloseableIterator.closeIterator} once the boundary signals no more rows).
 *   <li><b>Iteration failure:</b> when iterating it throws, the stream <em>and</em> the plan are
 *       released immediately before the exception propagates. TinkerPop auto-closes the traversal
 *       only on normal exhaustion, never on a thrown exception, so deferring the plan close would
 *       leak the cursor. The iteration failure stays the primary exception; a release failure is
 *       attached with {@code addSuppressed}.
 *   <li><b>Close:</b> {@link #close()} (which TinkerPop invokes on exhaustion and on early
 *       termination — e.g. a downstream limit cuts iteration short — via {@code Traversal.close()}
 *       closing every {@link AutoCloseable} step) closes the stream first, then the plan. It is
 *       idempotent.
 *   <li><b>Reset:</b> {@link #reset()} re-arms the step for a fresh pass on the same instance. It
 *       does not close the open stream directly (see the field notes); the next open closes a
 *       lingering cursor and rewinds the plan.
 *   <li><b>Reset after close:</b> a closed step re-arms too, by <em>replacing</em> the plan instead
 *       of rewinding it — see {@link #replaceClosedPlanWithCopy()}. Most re-iterations take this
 *       path: {@code toList()} closes the traversal in a {@code finally}, so every {@code
 *       traversal.toList(); admin.reset(); traversal.toList()} sequence arrives closed. A close
 *       that arrived before the step ever opened is the one exception: it released nothing, so the
 *       re-arm starts the original plan rather than a copy of it. A plan start that threw does not
 *       qualify — its own handler already closed the plan — so that step re-arms through the copy
 *       path like any other closed step.
 * </ul>
 *
 * <h2>The whole state machine</h2>
 * The prose above and the per-constant Javadoc each describe a slice. This table is the machine in
 * one place; when the two disagree, the enum constants are authoritative.
 *
 * <table border="1">
 *   <caption>State transitions and their effect on the plan</caption>
 *   <tr><th>From</th><th>Trigger</th><th>To</th><th>Effect on the plan</th></tr>
 *   <tr><td>NEW</td><td>open</td><td>OPEN</td><td>started, not rewound (it is pristine)</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>NEW</td><td>{@code close()}</td><td>CLOSED_UNSTARTED</td><td>nothing released</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>NEW</td><td>start threw</td><td>CLOSED</td><td>released by the failure handler</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>OPEN</td><td>stream drained</td><td>DRAINED</td><td>cursor closed, plan left open</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>OPEN / DRAINED</td><td>{@code reset()}</td><td>REARMED</td><td>untouched; the next open rewinds</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>OPEN / DRAINED</td><td>{@code close()}</td><td>CLOSED</td><td>stream and plan released</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>REARMED</td><td>open</td><td>OPEN</td><td>rewound in place, same plan object</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>CLOSED</td><td>{@code reset()}</td><td>REARMED_AFTER_CLOSE</td><td>still closed; the copy is deferred</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>CLOSED_UNSTARTED</td><td>{@code reset()}</td><td>NEW</td><td>untouched, still pristine</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>REARMED_AFTER_CLOSE</td><td>open</td><td>OPEN</td><td>replaced by a fresh copy, then started</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p>CLOSED, CLOSED_UNSTARTED and DRAINED all end {@link #processNextStart()} immediately. The two
 * CLOSED states make {@link #close()} a no-op; DRAINED does not, because it still holds an open plan.
 *
 * <h2>Which plan object an observer sees</h2>
 * The two re-arm paths install different plan objects — a rewind keeps the same plan, a re-arm
 * after close swaps in a copy — so the plan a subclass accessor exposes ({@code
 * YTDBMatchPlanStep.getPlan()}, {@code MultiPlanMatchStep.getPlans()}) is not stable across a step's
 * whole life. The contract those accessors carry, and the reason the swap is deferred to the next
 * open rather than done inside {@link #reset()}, is: <b>an observer reading the plan at any point
 * from the start of a pass to the {@link #close()} that ends it sees the plan object that produced
 * that pass's rows.</b> {@code YTDBQueryMetricsStep} reads the plan from inside the listener
 * callback it fires on close, so this is what makes the reported execution plan belong to the run
 * being reported. Between a {@link #reset()} and the next open the accessor still returns the
 * previous pass's plan, which is the same window in which the step has produced no new rows to
 * attribute.
